    “Who the hell are you?”
    — Vi, when Caitlyn approaches her jail cell in Season 1, Episode 4

    Caitlyn – “I took a look at your file. There’s no record of you or your crimes. What are you here for?”
    Vi – “My sunny personality.”
    Caitlyn – “You attacked an inmate. Why?”
    Vi – “Why not?”
    Caitlyn – “He was a witness in an ongoing investigation.”
    Vi – “Hmm, bummer.”
    Caitlyn – “This was a waste of time.”
    Vi – “Couldn’t have put it better. Hey, give Silco a kiss on that winning eye of his, will you?”
    Caitlyn – “Silco? The industrialist?”
    Vi – “Okay, this is getting old. Can you just send in whoever’s gonna kick the shit out of me, so I can get on with my night?”
    — Season 1, Episode 5

    Caitlyn – “Does this mean anything to you?”
    Vi – “Where did you get this?”
    Caitlyn – “My question first. He worked for Silco?”
    Vi – “Uh, they all do. How can anyone not know that? Where did you find this?”
    Caitlyn – “There was an attack. This is evidence. I need proof if I’m to believe what you’re saying about Silco.”
    Vi – “I could get it for you. Just not from in here.”
    Caitlyn – “In what mad world would I trust someone like you?”
    Vi – “Someone like me? You enforcers are all the same. Just asshole criminals in fancy uniforms. You know what? Find Silco yourself.”
    Caitlyn – “I will, thank you.”
    Vi – “Hm… Undercity’s gonna eat you alive.”
    — Season 1, Episode 5

    Caitlyn – “I heard the bathysphere has a nice view. That could be a good way to get a lay of the land.”
    Vi – “Too risky.”
    Caitlyn – “What…”
    — Season 1, Episode 5

    Vi – “Welcome to the Lanes.”
    Caitlyn – “You almost got me killed.”
    Vi – “My little sister could do that when she was seven. All us fissure folk can. Don’t you want to blend in?”
    — Season 1, Episode 5

    Vi – “Hmm?”
    Caitlyn – “No. Thank you.”
    Vi – “You’re missing out.”
    Caitlyn – “Are you going to question him?”
    Vi – “About what? The meat? Definitely not above board.”
    Caitlyn – “Silco. His connections? Isn’t that why we’re here?”
    Vi – “We’re here because I’m hungry. Do you know what prison food is like? No, of course you don’t.”
    Caitlyn – “Unbelievable. I didn’t break you out of jail to eat… slop. I knew this was a terrible idea. You don’t actually know anything, do you?”
    Vi – “Mm. Better than I remember.”
    — Season 1, Episode 5

    Vi – “Hmm.”
    Caitlyn – “Well, that place does look like it has bodies buried in the basement.”
    Vi – “You don’t know anything.”
    — Season 1, Episode 5

    Caitlyn – “How exactly do you propose we go about this?”
    Vi – “Let ‘em think you work here.”
    Caitlyn – “Excuse me? I will not.”
    Vi – “You know what your problem is?”
    Caitlyn – “Please. Tell me.”
    Vi – “You expect everyone to give you what you want. If you really want people to talk to you, you have to let them think you have what they want.”
    Caitlyn – “And what do I have?”
    Vi – “You’re hot, cupcake. So what’ll it be, man or woman?”
    Caitlyn – “Um…”
    — Season 1, Episode 5

    Vi – “Why did you let her go?”
    Caitlyn – “Do you ever say “thank you”?”
    Vi – “He’s gonna know we’re here now.”
    Caitlyn – “Whose fault is that?”
    — Season 1, Episode 5

    Vi – “You’re an all-right shot.”
    Caitlyn – “I’m an excellent shot.”
    Vi – “You gonna help me out, cupcake?”
    Caitlyn – “Stop calling me that. My name is Caitlyn.”
    Vi – “But you’re so sweet. Like a cupcake.”
    Caitlyn – “Shut up.”
    — Season 1, Episode 5

    Caitlyn – “Silco’s goons aren’t far behind. We have to keep moving.”
    Vi – “What the hell is that?”
    Caitlyn – “The sign.”
    Vi – “Never mind, just help me to the edge.”
    Caitlyn – “Can you do this in your- Shit.”
    — Season 1, Episode 6

    Caitlyn – “What is this place?”
    Vi – “It’s where the kind of people you topsiders don’t want to think about wind up.”
    — Season 1, Episode 6

    Caitlyn – “I know you have your reservations about me, but this only works if we can trust each other.”
    Vi – “It doesn’t work. It never has. You topsiders always find a way to screw us.”
    Caitlyn – “I suppose topside is to blame for all your misfortunes.”
    Vi – “No. Not all of them.”
    Caitlyn – “We aren’t monsters, you know. We’re people, just like you.”
    Vi – “You don’t know anything about me.”
    — Season 1, Episode 6

    Vi, hallucinating Powder – “I shouldn’t have left you.”
    Caitlyn – “It’s all right. Despite it all, I can tell… you have a good heart.”
    — Season 1, Episode 6

    Caitlyn – “Easy, easy, easy. We need you back on your feet. What was the name Sevika gave you? Jinx?”
    Vi – “Right. Jinx. How could I forget?”
    Caitlyn – “We’re going to have to be more careful now. Silco will be watching-”
    — Season 1, Episode 6

    Caitlyn – “You used to live here? Who’s Powder?”
    Vi – “My sister. I thought she died, but, no. I have to try and find her.”
    Caitlyn – “How do you not know if your sister is alive or dead?”
    Vi – “It’s hard to check up on people from inside a concrete cell.”
    Caitlyn – “What, you don’t have parents?”
    Vi – “No! They were killed by enforcers.”
    — Season 1, Episode 6

    Jinx – “Who’s she?”
    Caitlyn – “Who are you?”
    Vi – “It’s okay. She’s a friend.”
    —Season 1, Episode 6

    Jinx – “Sevika wasn’t lying? You’re with an enforcer?”
    Caitlyn – “Your sister is Jinx?”
    Vi – “Caitlyn, just listen, we can work this out.”
    Jinx – “This is a trick! You’re playing me!”
    —Season 1, Episode 6

    Jinx – “Shut up! I’m in no mood.”
    Caitlyn – “We didn’t say anything.”
    Jinx – “I wasn’t talking to you!”
    Vi – “Powder, it’s okay.”
    — Season 1, Episode 6

Act III

    Caitlyn – “I knew it was a mistake trusting you.”
    Vi – “You’ve been a real picnic yourself.”
    Caitlyn – “I’m not the one who walked us into, not one, but two of Silco’s traps.”
    Vi – “This isn’t Silco, it’s someone else.”
    Caitlyn – “How do you know?”
    Vi – “‘Cause we’d already be dead.”
    Caitlyn – “Oh, very nice. When were you planning to tell me that your lunatic sister works for him?”
    Vi – “Just as soon as you came clean about what the hell you’re really doing down here.”
    Caitlyn – “I told you the truth.”
    Vi – “Bullshit. What was that glowing stone? … That’s what I thought.”
    — Season 1, Episode 7

    Caitlyn – “What's going on?”
    Vi – “Hey, stop! Get your hands off of me!”
    Caitlyn – “Leave her alone!”
    Vi – “Let me go!”
    Caitlyn – “Vi? Vi! Vi!”
    — Season 1, Episode 7

    Mylo – “She cares about that enforcer, you saw it.”
    Jinx – “She was there for me! Not the enforcer.”
    Mylo – “Remember her name?”
    Jinx – “Why would I remember her name? Well, she’s just some stupid topsider! … Caitlyn.”
    — Season 1, Episode 7

    Caitlyn – “What have you done with Vi? Listen, let her go. I brought her here. It’s me you want.”
    Vi – “My hero.”
    Caitlyn – “You’re… But I thought you… I thought they were hurting you!”
    Ekko – “Vi tells me I can trust you.”
    — Season 1, Episode 7

    Vi – “Ekko, she believes what she’s saying, okay? She’s not your enemy.”
    Ekko – “Oh, yeah? Then what’s this?”
    Caitlyn – “You got it. You have to let me take that back.”
    —Season 1, Episode 7

    Vi – “What is it?”
    Caitlyn – “It’s a Gemstone. It was stolen during the attack. By your sister.”
    Vi – “You just forgot to mention that?”
    Caitlyn – “With this, someone with the right knowledge could build… any Hextech device. If enforcers are becoming more… aggressive, that’s why.”
    — Season 1, Episode 7

    Caitlyn – “What are they?”
    Vi – “We call them firelights. Never seen so many though.”
    — Season 1, Episode 7

    Vi – “It’s been real, cupcake. Thanks. For everything.”
    Jinx – “Shut up. It’s just a goodbye hug. She wouldn’t do that. Not again.”
    — Season 1, Episode 7

    Vi – “Caitlyn!”
    Jinx – “Liar.”
    — Season 1, Episode 7

    Vi – “Will you be okay? I’ll be right back.”
    Caitlyn – “Okay.”
    — Season 1, Episode 8

    Caitlyn – “It’s gone.”
    Vi – “What?”
    Caitlyn – “It was all for nothing.”
    — Season 1, Episode 8

    Vi – “Who lives here? Another Councilor friend of yours?”
    Cassandra – “Caitlyn! [...] And you found a stray.”
    Caitlyn – “This is Vi. She’s from the undercity.”
    Cassandra – “So I see. Could we have a word, Caitlyn? In private.”
    — Season 1, Episode 8

    Caitlyn – “We’ll present our case to the Council tonight.”
    Vi – “You did all this yourself? Without even going down there? And I thought Powder could get obsessed.”
    Caitlyn – “What happened to her, it’s not your fault.”
    Vi – “When my parents were still alive… me and Powder used to share a bed like this. Except, maybe, half the size.”
    — Season 1, Episode 8

    “Councilors, this is Vi. She was born in the undercity. Even though we failed her in countless ways, she risked everything to show me what life is really like down there.”
    — Caitlyn addressing the Council in Season 1, Episode 8

    Caitlyn – “Vi! Wait! Wait! Where are you going?”
    Vi – “I don’t know. Back where I came from? Seems like that’s what everyone up here wants.”
    Caitlyn – “I can fix this.”
    Vi – “You can’t! This is how things are. How they’ve always been. I was so stupid to think it could change.”
    Caitlyn – “There must be something else we can do. Some other way. We’ll make a new plan. We have to try.”
    Vi – “We tried. Okay? It wasn’t enough. Topside and bottom. Oil and water. That’s all there is.”
    Caitlyn – “What about us?”
    Vi – “Oil and water. Wasn’t meant to be.”
    Caitlyn – “You’re just saying that.”
    Vi – “Do yourself a favor, cupcake. Go back to that big, shiny house of yours and just… forget me, okay?”
    — Season 1, Episode 8

    Vi – “Huh?”
    Jinx – “I paid your girlfriend a visit this morning.”
    Vi – “What did you do?”
    Jinx – “I made her a snack.”
    Vi – “Huh? No!”
    Jinx – “Sheesh. I’m not that crazy.”
    Vi – “Powder! Leave her out of this.”
    — Season 1, Episode 9

    Jinx – “Make her go away. Please. Send her on her way and- And you can have Powder back.”
    Caitlyn – “Mm.”
    Vi – “I can’t.”
    Jinx – “Ah.”
    Caitlyn – “No! Powder, listen. We… we can just go. We’ll leave and never come back.”
    —Season 1, Episode 9

    Vi – “Wait! She’s my sister.”
    Caitlyn – “Vi, she’s too far gone.”
    Vi – “No, no, no.”
    — Season 1, Episode 9

Season 2
Act I

    Vi – “You were right, Cait. Powder’s gone. I can make this right. If you get Jayce to fix the gauntlets, I can do this myself. No one else needs to get hurt.”
    Caitlyn – “No. No more rogue mission. No more reckless plans. My mother was right. My arrogance led me to take on more than I could handle, and she paid the price.”
    — Season 2, Episode 1

    Caitlyn – “They’re sending all the Enforcers after Jinx. I’m going with them.”
    Vi – “Please, I have to help.”
    Caitlyn – “You can. As one of us.”
    Vi – “Cait, I can’t wear this.”
    Caitlyn – “People are calling for blood. The Council won’t stop them. You can show that not all of Zaun supports Jinx. We can show them. Together.”
    Vi – “I watched them kill my parents. Do you have any idea how that feels?”
    Caitlyn – “Yes. I do. I thought you were on our side.”
    Vi – “You didn’t think at all.”
    — Season 2, Episode 1

    Vi – “Thought for sure you were gonna get yourself killed.”
    Caitlyn – “A memorial. What kind of animals?”
    Vi – “They wanted the spectacle, alright. They’re trying to scare you.”
    Caitlyn – “All they did is piss me off.”
    Vi – “You… You need to find a way to call off the invasion.”
    Caitlyn – “What?”
    Vi – “This battle was on your soil. Down there, you’ll be on their terms.”
    Caitlyn – “None of this is on our terms.”
    Vi – “Maybe you should change that.”
    Caitlyn – “Well, I don’t know how, okay? She dies and leaves this giant hole, and I’m just supposed to fill it. Like she was never there to begin with.”
    Vi – “Hey. You won’t. The hole gets smaller, but… you never fill it.”
    Caitlyn – “I was wrong to spring the badge on you. It’s just… every way I slice it, if I go after your sister alone, one of us comes back in a box. It’s all coming apart.”
    Vi – “No, it isn’t. We won’t let it.”
    — Season 2, Episode 1

    Caitlyn – “You’re a confessed criminal. You’ll spend your retirement in a cell. Check your gear. This is what we’ve trained for.”
    Vi – “Can I get a minute?”
    — Season 2, Episode 3

    Vi – “I think we should cut the others loose. Listen, if that Heenot idiot is telling the truth, Jinx is gonna have surprises in store for us.”
    Caitlyn – “All the more reason to bring backup.”
    Vi – “She’ll smell their nerves a mile away and find a way to use them against us. Tell me I’m wrong.”
    Caitlyn – “I can’t let her get away again. Are you sure you’re ready to..?”
    Vi – “My sister is gone. There’s only Jinx now. It has to end. I’m so sorry about your mother. I’m sorry I can’t bring her back, but please just… Everyone in my life has changed. Promise me you won’t change.”
    Caitlyn – “I won’t.”
    — Season 2, Episode 3

    Vi – “Cait. If you see an opening… take the shot.”
    Caitlyn – “Vi.”
    — Season 2, Episode 3

    Jinx – “I know you’re sweet on her. Hope you got a chance to, you know… Before…”
    Vi – “I’m ready.”
    — Season 2, Episode 3

    Caitlyn – “Get away from her.”
    Vi – “Cait.”
    Caitlyn – “Move.”
    Jinx – “Scram, kid.”
    — Season 2, Episode 3

    Vi – “Cait, she’s a child.”
    Caitlyn – “Move! She’s not getting away again.”
    Vi – “Cait.”
    Caitlyn – “Move.”
    Vi – “Cait!”
    Caitlyn – “Season 2, Episode 3”

    Vi – “Cait.”
    Caitlyn – “You stopped me.”
    Vi – “I shouldn’t have had to.”
    Caitlyn – “I had the shot.”
    Vi – “That was a kid. What if you missed?”
    Caitlyn – “I wasn’t going to miss.”
    Vi – “What’s wrong with you?”
    Caitlyn – “I keep telling myself that you’re different. But you’re not. It’s her blood in your veins.”
    Vi – “Then why are you the one acting like her?”
    — Season 2, Episode 3

Act II

    Vi – “On the job, I see.”
    Caitlyn – “You can’t be here.”
    Vi – “Oh. Here, like where I landed when this rich, unhinged mongoose just tackled me?”
    Caitlyn – “Mongoose? Your hair. You look like an angry oil slick.”
    Vi – “Don’t sugarcoat it, cupcake.”
    — Season 2, Episode 6

    Vi – “Who’s out there?”
    Caitlyn – “We tracked some sort of new chemweapon down here. A bloodthirsty murderous beast. What are you doing here?”
    Vi – “Trying to save… my dad.”
    — Season 2, Episode 6

    Caitlyn – “It’s Vi.”
    Vi – “So much for happy reunions.”
    Ambessa – “Well done, Caitlyn.”
    —Season 2, Episode 6

    Ambessa – “Vi. You’ve been quite a curiosity. The one who captured Caitlyn’s heart. I owe you thanks. Your absence provided a vacuum I was able to fill. In other circumstances, I might have offered you a position in my organization. Your resilience is undeniable. Of course, that won’t be possible. You cause too many complications. Caitlyn must not be distracted.”
    Vi – “Don’t worry, she’s not distracted. You know, my father taught me about trust. He told me if I wanted it, there were only three things I needed to do: Be honest, even if it means telling a self-righteous windbag that her breath smells like a cesspool. Be patient. Mm, still haven’t quite cracked that one, but being tied up sure helps.”
    Ambessa – “And the third?”
    Vi – “Just shut the fuck up.”
    — Season 2, Episode 6

    Caitlyn – “The fissures are blocked by guard towers. Patrols circle the commune at even intervals. Her personal guard are posted here, here, and here. They aren’t expecting trouble at home. With flawless timing and luck and…”
    Vi – “A big distraction.”
    Caitlyn – “Whatever you do, don’t underestimate Ambessa.”
    — Season 2, Episode 6

Act III

    Caitlyn – “Vi? Vi? Vi?!”
    Jayce – “Come on. We need to get out of here.”
    — Season 2, Episode 8

    Vi – “Where are the others? Cait? Jinx?”
    Loris – “Jinx. Caitlyn wanted to be here to tell you herself.”
    — Season 2, Episode 8

    Vi – “Arrested?!”
    Caitlyn – “I can handle this, Maddie. Check on my father?”
    — Season 2, Episode 8

    Caitlyn – “Vi.”
    Vi – “She saved your life.”
    Caitlyn – “If you will just calm down for one…”
    Vi – “Even knowing you’d never have done the same for her.”
    Caitlyn – “We’ll never know, will we? You didn’t let me in on that part of your plan.”
    Vi – “Clearly the right call, since you still can’t trust her enough not to shove her in a box.”
    Caitlyn – “Trust? You believe I’m so daft I can’t recognize a contingency? She wasn’t there for my benefit. She was there because you didn’t trust me to follow through.”
    Vi – “Can you blame me? How long were you sidled up with that shifty, self-serving war pig? She oinked poison in your ear and you just ate it.”
    Caitlyn – “I know! The only thing Jinx cared about was getting you to safety. Then she just surrendered. I didn’t even have time to think before they hauled her off. She’s being held in the bunker while I… while I decide what to do. I was waiting for you to recover.”
    Vi – "Cait, she’s changed."
    Caitlyn – “We can’t erase our mistakes. None of us.”
    Vi – "Who decides who gets a second chance?"
    — Season 2, Episode 8

    Jinx – “You don’t have to worry about me anymore. You don’t need to feel guilty about being happy. You deserve to be with her.”
    Vi – “Wait.”
    — Season 2, Episode 8

    Caitlyn – “Had a feeling I might find you here.”
    Vi – “I really believed she’d help. Say it. You told me so. I was an idiot to trust her. I went behind your back. I choose wrong every time. And because of it, I’ve lost everyone.”
    Caitlyn – “You really think I needed all the guards at the Hexgates? Sorry to say, you’ve grown a bit predictable.”
    — Season 2, Episode 8

    Caitlyn – “Uh, listen, while you were gone, I saw someone…”
    Vi – “Cait. I don’t fucking care.”
    — Season 2, Episode 8

    Caitlyn – “Is that… singing?”
    Vi – “It’s just a tune my mother used to hum.”
    Caitlyn – “Are you still in this fight, Violet?”
    Vi – “I am the dirt under your nails, cupcake. Nothing’s gonna clean me out.”
